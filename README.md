# CRICRADIO--Real-Time-Cricket-Data-Scraping
Python-based web scraping system for the CREX cricket website. It monitors match schedules, extracts details like team names, scores, overs, dates, and live status from the match listing page, and scrapes detailed match data from "Match info," "Squads," "Live," and "Scorecard" tabs, storing everything in an Excel file.
